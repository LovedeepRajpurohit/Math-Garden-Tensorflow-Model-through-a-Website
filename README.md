## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LovedeepRajpurohit/Math-Garden-Tensorflow-Model-through-a-Website.git
   cd Math-Garden-Tensorflow-Model-through-a-Website
   ```

2. **Set up the Python environment**:
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Install the required Python dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Set up the frontend**:
   - Install Node.js dependencies (if applicable):
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```

4. **Run the application**:
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - Start the frontend (if separate):
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

5. **Open in browser**:
   Open `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port) in your browser to access the application.
